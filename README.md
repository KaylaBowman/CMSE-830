This project is an app programmed to receive user input regarding listening goals (Happy, Sad, Calm, Dance) and recommend songs based on those goals. These recommendations are made based on correlations between reported mental health stats (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD) and listening habits (how frequently participants listened to 16 different genres). Recommendations are then improved by filtering based on song features (Valence, Energy, and Danceability).
