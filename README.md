This project consists of an app programmed to receive user input regarding listening goals (ex: feel happy, sad, nostalgic, dancey, etc) and recommend songs based on those goals. These recommendations are made based on this data analysis that extracts correlations between reported mental health stats (anxiety, depression, inssomnia, and OCD) and listening habits (how frequently participants listened to 16 different genres).
